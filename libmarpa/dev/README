This is the developer's directory.  Files here are not necessary to
build libmarpa.  They are necessary if you want to change the code.

Special tools (such as Cweb) are required.  These tools are all free,
readily available, and highly portable.  *But* these tools are not
included.  It may not be easy or even possible to install all these
tools on some of the systems to which libmarpa, Marpa or Marpa::XS
can be ported.
