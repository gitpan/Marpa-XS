This is the developer's directory.  Files here are not necessary to
build libmarpa.  They are necessary if you want to change the code.

Special tools (such as Cweb) are required.  These tools are all free,
readily available, and highly portable.  *But* these tools are not
included, and are not necessarily installable on every system to which
libmarpa, Marpa or Marpa::XS is ported.
