=head1 NAME

ToDo - Marpa's To Do List

=head1 MEDIUM PRIORITY

=over 4

=item * Test null parse for Single Parse Evaluator.

=item * Add symbol & rule ranker tests to code_diag.t.

=item * Add a test for infinite_scale & infinite_rules.

=item * On ambiguous grammars, it may optimize to save values of reset
bocage nodes from the first reset, and simply copy them back in
on subsequent resets.  In particular for the sorted choices.
Note this optimizes only to the degree the user wants multiple
parses, or else require multiple interations to get the parse she
wants.

=item * Add optimizations when max_parses <= 1
    For example, no need to prune duplicate parses

=item * Add MAX_COUNT for rules.  Implement on one of left- and right-
    recursion only.  No immediate need for both.

=item * When rereading Internals doc, check if
parse bocage creation can probably be made cleaner.

=back

=head1 MAYBE, MAYBE NOT

=over 4

=item * Add a trace_choices option?

=item * Add a show_derivation option.
